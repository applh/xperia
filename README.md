                },
                {
                    "file": "image-2",
                    "caption": "test caption 2",
                    "description": "test description 2"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## TODOS / IDEAS

* Use slug name for home pages
  * Currently page id is used
* Add several pages to subdomains

* Add a public key to api key

* Add plugin update from uploaded zip archive

* Add email template to api attachments
* Add email PHP proxy code generator

* Add android app to send SMS from WP website API

* Add code in post_content
  * FIXME: sanitize_post removes tags like `<script>`, etc...
